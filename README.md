## Features



## How It Works

This end-to-end app is powered by React, Flask, and MongoDB to create a responsive and real-time experience that stays up to date on all of your latest matches. 


- When a user initially registers, we fetch their entire match history from the past year to add it to our own private database.

- These stats are then kept up-to-date by using Github Actions, where matches from our registered users are automatically added to keep data fresh.

- Finally, using a Flask API to handle database requests, our React front-end displays all of this data in responsive charts.
